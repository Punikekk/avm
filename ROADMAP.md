Long-term goals
===============

Easy to run, easy to build, easy to extend: 

- X-platform support for modern desktop (win, mac, unix on cpu x86_64, arm64)
- Separate AVM+ runtime as dynamic library
- Separate AVM+ extensions as run-time modules

Roadmap
-------

- [x] CMake-based build
- [x] CI build and test
- [ ] Dockerized application
- [ ] Documentation for parts of that repository
- [ ] Separate AVM+ runtime as dynamic library
- [ ] Documentation for running AVM+ as part of your application
- [ ] Separate AVM+ extensions as run-time modules
- [ ] Documentation for writing an extension for AVM+
- [ ] Support for arm64 cpu
- [ ] Documentation for writing platform implementation
