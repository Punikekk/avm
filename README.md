AVM Plus
========

AVM Plus is the virtual machine to run ActionScript3 bytecode. This repository 
is based on a collaboration of a lot of people over years finally taken from
[tamarin](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Tamarin)

What that project is for
------------------------

That project is to bring life to the most common virtual machine over the
decades. The main goals are to make it available for modern desktop platforms. 
I will also make decisions according to the next terms:

- Simple is better than complex
- It is JIT-only and not AOT
- Fridge is not supported
- Custom features to VM should be removed from the base and easy to plug-in

License
-------

Most of it is available on MPLv2 for now and some parts are available
on other licenses (same as tamarin). I will make a final decision on that later.
